  <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
  <p>
    1. Ive learnt I have a lot of growing to do with my EQ. Learning that EQ involves things like managing emotions and having self-confidence has helped me to see where I can improve by having a bit of faith in myself and answers.
    <br>2. I've learned the value of recognizing my strengths and weaknesses. Writing them down has shown me that I often underestimate myself and don't give myself enough credit.
    <br>3. I also learned that it's super important to celebrate my progress. Before, I would be really tough on myself and only see my flaws, making me feel like I wasn't good enough. But during this course, I've tried to stay positive and recognize how much I've improved.
  </p>

  <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
  <p>
    As a student, I've discovered that understanding who I am, my values, and being self-aware is really important in figuring out how I learn and interact with others, especially in programming where collaboration is key.
    Empathy plays a vital role in programming as well. It's about connecting with my teammates on a deeper level. When I can understand their perspectives and put myself in their shoes, it strengthens our relationship. We can relate to each other better and offer support when needed. It's all about creating a positive and supportive environment that encourages teamwork.
  </p>

  <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
  <p>
    I was really surprised by two things. First, I used to think EQ was just about being good at socializing and understanding others (which I think I'm pretty good at), but it turned out to be much more than that. It made me realize that I need to work on positive self-talk and building up my confidence.
    The second thing that caught me off guard was the importance of listening and looping. I realized that when someone is talking to me, I really have to concentrate and make sure I remember everything they said. It got me thinking about how I'm always rushing around, trying to do a million things at once and multitasking. I need to slow down, be more present, and focus on one thing at a time.
  </p>
  
  <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
  <p>It was really easy spend lots of time looking up information because I really like reading about psychology and how you can improve yourself. I sometimes find typing out what I’ve found into a blog hard as well because I’m worried that it doesn’t make sense. I think this was another challenge for me and it relates to my self-confidence (i.e being worried about how will people perceive what I’ve written).</p>

  <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
  <p>
    As much as I hated talking about myself, I don't feel like the time I spent studying core learning here was a waste. In fact, it was one of the reasons I chose to join Dev Academy. I believe that these skills are super important because they can be applied to anything in life, not just programming.
    Having core learning mixed into each sprint is actually a nice change of pace. If we only did coding for five weeks straight, it could get overwhelming. So, having that variety is beneficial. Plus, it gives us a chance to reflect on what we've learned, which is a really important part of the learning process.
    Overall, I think core learning is valuable. It helps us become more well-rounded learners and gives us time to think about what we've learned. It's definitely not a waste of time!
