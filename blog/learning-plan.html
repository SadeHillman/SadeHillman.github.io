    <p>
      Honestly as a newbie to the tech world I’m not sure where id go after this but I’m learning more about what I want and what works for me every single day!
    </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>
      I'm to learn the skills that will make me a kickass Front-end developer. Once I graduate from Dev Academy, my aim is to challenge myslef in the tech world and make a positive impact. While I don't have a specific place in mind right now, I'm open to exploring different opportunities and finding a team where I can contribute my skills. My ultimate goal is to create awesome websites and applications that people love to use and enjoy.

    <h3>Strengths & Limitations in Learning</h3>

    <h4> Strengths </h4>
    <p>
      Carrying on from my strengths in my Identity blog, I have a love for learning! I love to learn something new everyday and with programming there is always something new to learn. 
      My more logical side likes to think things through and weigh up options, before coming to a final decision.
    </p>
  
    <h4>Limitations</h4>
    <p>
      A few of my limitations include seeing things through to completion and socialising.  
      I tend to start something and once I’m bored or feel like I’ve learnt everything I could in a certain area I do something else. 
      Ive been learning to code for 2 months now and enjoying it so far but it does worry me a bit. 
      I also struggle with talking to people and building relationships, I know it drains me and so I tend to keep to myself unless necessary which can be a problem
      when connecting with team mates. 
    </p>
    <h3>Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>
      Based on these strengths and limitations, I'm confident that my passion for learning will keep me going strong in Bootcamp. It's what drives me to dive into new concepts and grow my skills. Of course, I'm aware that I need to tackle my limitations head-on. Staying focused, finishing what I start, and actively connecting with my peers are crucial strategies I'll employ. I'm determined to work on these areas and make sure I have an awesome learning experience in Bootcamp. Let's do this!

    <h3>Core skills with Dev Academy</h3>
    <p>
      Some core skills I’m interested in learning while working with Dev Academy include:
      Communicating my ideas and opinions confidently end effectively. 
      Organisation and time-management skills.<br>
      Sometimes i struggle to build relationships in teams because I zone out when people talk or talk over them when a topic I want to discuss comes up. 
      Any organisation skills i have go out the window at a minor inconvienience and my time management is non existent no matter how many planners I buy. 
      So these are some skills I would love to work on while with Dev Academy. </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>
      I want to continue working on the same things i did through foundations, im getting better at asking questions and reaching out to the team so id like to focus on that. my time management has been way off the past month and i think it would help me to start getting back on track.
    </p>  
  </section> 

  <h3>My expectations of facilitators & Seeking help</h3>
  <p>All I expect is compassion and respect for everyone which I can already see and feel from the all the facilitators here at Dev Academy.</p>
  <p>
    Honestly I am a little scared to ask for help in the chat, I have ANXIETY when I don’t have all the answers and then stress about it :) 
    But here today writing this I VOW to ask for help whenever my tomato time stops. I will throw it to my software developer partner first because I do lol but then the team and my facilitators if we’re all stumped.
  </p>
  <h3>Bootcamp</h3>
  <p>
    I have a feeling bootcamp is going take a lot of adjusting for me like i just got use to asking Lani questions after 12 weeks now in the actual bootcamp im going to have to ask someone i dont know so thats great.
    I dont really know what to expect over the next few months but im excited.

  <h3>How i plan to manage my workload</h3>
  <p>So far toggle has helped me so much!! There is an easy 25 min tomato I click on and get stuck into my work. 
    The best part of this for me is I can do 25 mins!! My brain is ok saying “ok we’re just going to sit down for 25 then you’re done!”. 
    This is definately tool im going to keep using!</p>
  <p> 
    When it does start getting to me i will <br>
    Stop. Breath. Take a break. Talk to a friend. 
    I get overwhelmed and overstimulated pretty easy, so these steps help me every day. Depending on the situation I enjoy meditating, blasting music or cleaning the house to destress. Once I’ve been able to breath, I go back in with a clear mind and get ‘er done.
  </p>
  <h3>Bootcamp</h3>
  <p>
    I feel better about asking for help, i think just posting more questions and talking to my pairs will help alot, so ill give it 20mins before asking for help through bootcamp.
