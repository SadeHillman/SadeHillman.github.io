    <h1>Te Whare Tapa Wha</h1>
  </div>
  <div id="about">
    <p>
      Welcome to my blog where I'll apply the four dimensions of Te Whare Tapa Whā, a holistic model of well-being, to my learning plan. Let's dive into each aspect:
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing): I focus on strengthening my body through regular exercise, healthy eating, and improving my sleep pattern. 
    I enjoy morning exercises and walking my son to daycare a few days a week. Meal prepping on Sundays helps ensure nutritious meals throughout the week.
  </p>
  
  <p>    
    Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing): I take care of my mind and emotions by meditating every day and writing in my journal often. 
    When I feel stressed or overwhelmed, I find comfort in activities like listening to music, browsing online stores (adding things to my cart), or playing games. 
    These things help me relax and feel better.
 </p>

  <p>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing): I explore different ways to find meaning and inner peace in life. I acknowledge our Atua through Karakia (prayer) and 
    prefer appreciating the present moment rather than keeping a gratitude journal. Taking the time to truly appreciate the people, opportunities, and things in my life brings me a sense of spiritual connection.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing): I believe in the significance of family, friends, and community, and I strive to build strong relationships. 
    I connect with my family by enjoying quality time together, going on adventures, playing games, and having movie nights. 
    These activities help us bond and create special memories.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment): we'er lucky enough to have a home next to the gardens and forest that feel like a world away from the city right here in auckland.
    When we get the chance we love to take our son into the bush and enjoy the sounds of the water running through the creek. We take the dogs through the gardens and just sit and enjoy nature.
    I also love to garden throughout the year growing various lettuces and tomatos in our green house.
