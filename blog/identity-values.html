    <h1>Identity & Values</h1>

    <div id="about">
      <h3>About</h3>
     <p>This blog section is about my identity and the values i carry with me through life everyday.</p>
  </div>

     <h3>Ethical Decision</h3>
     <p>One of my previous jobs, we had an instance of a new manager coming into the store and within two weeks of being there she had been accusing staff of theft without discussing it with those team members and telling team members not to trust each other.

      It took me 3 days to think over what I should do about it, I am a very straight forward person and I’m not afraid to stick up for myself but other people were also involved which meant speaking up could put them in a vulnerable position too.
      
      I called an HR representative without using names to get advice and together we decided taking it straight to the regional manager would be the best option as this was now considered harassment and work place bullying. I spoke with the regional manager and recommended more training on how to handle “suspicious activity” and not sharing sensitive information throughout the team as it can create a hostile work environment.
      
      Looking back i’m glad I reported it, she had the opportunity to learn from it and the team was grateful that someone spoke up for them as it was effecting everyone. One thing I would do differently is after all this she asked me to go get coffee and talk but I never went, at the time I didn’t want to hear an explanation or apology but maybe I should have heard her out so yeah.</p>

      <h3>Strengths Evidence</h3>
      <img src="../images/strengths.png" alt="list of strengths">
      <p>“What would you say some of my values are?”<br>
        <br>My Partner:
        “Uhhhhhhm you are, what’s it called, dependable…no that’s not a value. Family is big for you, uhhhmm, values values values I don’t know what a value is.”<br>
        <br>My Mum:
        “He kai kei aku ringa - There is food at the end of my hands.” “You will never be without, you know how to use what you have to create more”<br>
        <br>My BestFriend: … she went on for a long time, it was all great stuff but I don’t want to write it all out. Ambitious, Reliable, Family, Honest, Thoughtful, Bubbly, an all round GC.

        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p> One thing i don't like calling a limitation but definatly has its challenges is managing my ADHD.
          I feel like a lot of people see ADHD as a little boy that cant sit still and so a lot
          of people struggle to understand how it effects someones day to day. I know i struggle with any kind of time management which is why i had to chose the morning meeting
          otherwise i'll be stuck doing nothing until 4pm. Its why i start studying in the middle of clearing the table and why i never finish a cup of coffee 
          because i loose it around the house and its a day later when i find it. The good thing is i know these things about myself and have
          an amazing support system and stratigies to make life a little more manageable.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Cultural Influence</h3>
      <p>Being of Maori heritage and growing up on our marae meant having a very strong connection with my extended
        family and our land. Having a deeper understanding of who I am and where I come from allowed me to be more open minded and respectful of other cultures, their traditions and their customs. Coming from a low income family taught me the value of being grateful, growing your own food and building meaningful relationships.
       
       All of these influenced my identity and who I am today. I am resilient and kind, giving is my love language and I can adapt and thrive in any environment. 
       
       My top strength in the strength finder test is “Love - Valuing close relation, sharing and caring” which fits my values perfectly. 
       
       A few other top strengths included “Love of Learning”, “Hope”, “Judgement” and “Forgiveness”. 
       These strengths support my learning journey by allowing me to enjoy learning new things, having a positive attitude towards future outcomes, the ability to think things through and weigh evidence fairly while giving myself grace and space to learn. </p>
       
       <h3>Working with others, strategies and reflection</h3>
      <p>During my time as a Key-holder I was often the person in charge which meant assigning sections and tasks for staff. Occasionally there would be a few staff on that loved a good chat even when customers were in store or tasks weren’t competed. 

        One of the strategies I used to maximise production was to assign tasks at separate ends of the store, another was to set their breaks at the same time so they could catch up outside instead of on the shop floor. These worked sometimes but they would always gravitate back to each other. 
        
        Other strategies I would try now would be working with them 1-1 and train them to be focused on the tasks while developing their skills to be future leaders. I think managers showing an interest in their  employees development helps them engage with the tasks and have a sense of pride in their work.</p>
