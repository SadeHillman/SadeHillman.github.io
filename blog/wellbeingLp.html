    <h3>Long Term Goals. Career Pathway.</h3>
    <p>
      Once I graduate from Dev Academy, my aim is to challenge myself in the tech world and make a positive impact.
      While I don't have a specific place in mind right now, I'm open to exploring different opportunities and finding a team where I can contribute and develop my skills.
    </p>

    <h3>Strengths</h3>
    <p>
      I have a love for learning! One of the reasons I have an interest in programming is the constant development and growth that happens throughout the tech industry. I get a sense of excitement in the fact that I will never know everything there is to know.
      I'm also a problem solver! I'm willing to jump in and give it a go, fail and fail again each time learning from that experience and trying something new until it's done.
    </p>

    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <p>
      One of the limitations I have is when it comes to communicating on a social level. I don't really "get" people. I got a job in retail to work on my customer service skills, but beyond that, most interactions seem shallow to me.
      (Even though people say "Sade, you're not supposed to say that out loud," but why?) I would like to work on how to develop relationships within a work environment.

    <h3>Core Skills with Dev Academy</h3>
    <p>
      Some core skills I'm interested in learning while working with Dev Academy include:<br>
      - Communicating my ideas and opinions confidently and effectively.<br>
      - Listening to other people properly.<br>
      - How to navigate working with someone you don't really like.
    </p>
    <h3>Navigating Overwhelm</h3>
    <p>
      Stop. Breathe. Take a break. Talk to a friend.<br> 
      I get overwhelmed and overstimulated pretty easily, so these steps help me every day. 
      Depending on the situation, I enjoy meditating, blasting music, or cleaning the house to de-stress. 
      Once Iâ€™ve been able to breathe, I go back in with a clear mind and get 'er done.
