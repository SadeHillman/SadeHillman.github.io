  <h1>CSS Display: inline vs inline-blocks</h1>
<p>I chose to research more about the use of <em>"display: inline;"</em> vs <em>"display: inline-block;"</em> because it is one of the things I had difficulty understanding the most!
  While trying to get the layout of my web page right I noticed when using different element types they all moved differently.
</p>

<h4>First, to understand what's happening let's look at 2 types of elements:</h4>

<p>1. I created the below list using &lt;p&gt; tags. Paragraphs are a "block" element. Block elements take up the whole width of a web page.</p>
<p class="example-one">One</p>
<p class="example-one">Two</p>
<p class="example-one">Three</p>


<p>2. I created the above links using &lt;a&gt; tags. Links are a "inline" element. Link elements only take up the space of the content.</p>
<a class="example-two" href="">One</a>
<a class="example-two" href="">Two</a>
<a class="example-two" href="">Three</a>

<h4>What does it mean to display: inline;?</h4>
<p>Inline elements only taking up the space of its context means we aren't able to add margin, padding, height or width attributes to style. While this isn't very 
  useful when trying to edit your layout it's a great way to prevent any issues with links being bigger or out-of-place when nested in paragraphs.</p>

<h4>What does it mean to display: inline-block;?</h4>
<p>Inline-block makes it possible for us to take inline elements and display them as inline-level blocks. This means it will hold the inline format but now we can add margins, padding, height and width.
This is perfect for displaying multiple links in a button style.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Both inline and inline-block displays have their important roles throughout our web page layouts! One helps keep our page manageable and easy to continue adding CSS throughout while the other allows us
  to create beautiful design elements. I wish I had started on this earlier, it would have helped a lot when setting
  up my navigation bar for my home page :).
