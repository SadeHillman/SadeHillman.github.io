  <h3>Benefits of understanding:</h3>
  <p>
    Understanding neuroplasticity helps us learn better and gain new skills by letting our brains 
    adapt and make new connections. If someone has a brain injury or stroke, neuroplasticity helps 
    them recover by rerouting pathways in their brain. It also makes our brains more flexible, which 
    means we can solve problems and be more creative. By understanding neuroplasticity, we can keep 
    our brains healthy, feel good mentally, and find new ways to help people with brain problems.
  </p>

  <h3>Engaging for my benefit:</h3>
  <p>
    I have a growth mindset and believe in my ability to improve. I actively engage in learning 
    by participating and solving problems. I explore various learning methods, such as reading, 
    videos, pair-programming, and hands-on exercises. I learn with intention, I practice by setting 
    goals, receiving feedback, and making adjustments.I value rest and breaks, I like to give my 
    brain time to absorb information. I stay motivated and resilient, embracing challenges along the way. 
    I am constantly assessing, adapting, and exploring, I evaluate my progress, make changes, and discover 
    new things in my learning journey.<br>
    <br>
    In summary, I embrace growth, explore methods, practice with intention, rest, stay motivated, and adapt to unlock my full learning potential.

    <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
  </div>

  <h3>What is a growth mindset?</h3>
  <p>Having a growth mindset means believing that you can get better at things if you try hard and practice. 
    It's like knowing that your brain and abilities are not fixed, 
    but can grow and improve over time. Instead of giving up when something is difficult, 
    a growth mindset helps you see challenges as opportunities to learn and become better. 
    It's about being determined, not getting discouraged by mistakes, and understanding that effort is important 
    for success. With a growth mindset, you can achieve more and become the best version of yourself.

  <h3>What surprised me, changes for me.</h3>
  <p>Seeing the power of yet as the recommended watch was probably the biggest surprise because its one of my favourite Ted talks, 
    I recommend this to everyone I hear talk about being too dumb or scared to not good enough to help them 
    see its going to be okay and to just give it your best. 
    As for changes I felt it was a great refresher and helped me to relax a little remember Iâ€™m still learning 
    and to go easy on myself.
  </p>

  <h3>Integrating growth mindset into my learning</h3>
  <p>
    I believe in my ability to improve. I know that with effort and practice, 
    my skills and intelligence can develop over time. I know it's important to ask for help and feedback 
    when I need it. Whether it's from facilitators, mentors, or friends, getting their 
    advice helps me grow and get better at things. I also try to stay positive and happy while I'm learning. 
    I celebrate every little success I have and remember how far I've come. Setting goals that I can actually 
    achieve keeps me motivated and excited to keep learning new things.
