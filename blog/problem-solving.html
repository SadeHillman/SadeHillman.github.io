  <h3>Blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
  <p>
      So, I had a problem adding a ”ben" property to the "terah" object's "children" property. 
      I had to make "ben" an object with the name "Ben".

  <h4>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
  <p>
    I tried something first and went through a few different ideas I thought may work and 
    I used google and w3 school to try get a better understanding of properties. 
    In the end I asked my partner and he helped me to understand the differences between what I was 
    trying to do and what the question was asking me to do.
  </p>
  
  <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
  <p>It was frustrating, especially trying to understand what I was meant to be doing. 
    Looking back it seems like such an easy thing so I’m a little like how did you miss that but we got there in the end.
  </p>
  
  <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
  <p>
    From this problem, I learned how to add properties to objects and assign objects to other object properties. 
    I also got a better understanding of object syntax and how to manipulate objects.
  </p>

  <h3>Elegantly solved a problem.</h3>

  <p>
    One of the test questions was to write a function called fizzbuzz that takes a number
    as its input and returns the number itself, unless the number is divisible by 15, 5, or 3. 
    In those cases, the function should return the strings "FizzBuzz", "Buzz", or "Fizz”.
  </p>

  <h4>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
  <p>
    I started by writing out the pseudo code. I broke the problem down into smaller sub-problems.
    I refreshed my understanding of how the modulo operator works  and I did my best.
  </p>

  <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
  <p>
    I was really proud of myself for this one. After a quick refresher on the modulo operator
    I was able to write the entire function from just what I’ve learnt so far. I was feeling a 
    little defeated being frustrated over a simple questions earlier so this was a big bounce back 
    to realise I am taking it in and I do understand more than I think I do.
  </p>

  <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
  <p>
    I learnt to trust myself a little more,
    realise I am capable and I am learning and to just take a breath, 
    im not going to know everything today and that’s OK!
  </p>

  <h4> Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h4>
  <p>
    * Pseudocode 5 stars <br>
    * Trying something 5 stars <br>
    * Rubber ducky method 5 stars <br>
    * Reading error messages 3 Stars <br>
    * Console.logging 5 stars <br>
    * Googling 5 stars <br>
    * Asking your peers for help 3 stars <br>
    * Asking coaches for help 1 star <br>
    * Improving your process with reflection 5 stars
  </p>

  <h4>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.</h4>
  <p>I guess whenever it seems like a simple question to me I don’t like to ask because I don’t want to seem 
    dumb or I don’t like being wrong or I just don’t like bothering people.</p>
