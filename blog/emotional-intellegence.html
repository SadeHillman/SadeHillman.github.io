  <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
  <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to identify, evaluate and express emotions. 
    It means controlling your emotions, demonstrating empathy and connecting with people.
    We use our emotions to facilitate thinking. In summary emotional intellignce is managing
     and understanding your own and other peoples emotions.</p>

  <h3>Whats the difference between Emotinal Quotient
    (EQ) and Intelligence Quotient (IQ)?</h3>
 <p >EQ is measured by 5 componants, empathy, communication, self-awearness, self-regulation and self-motivation.<br>
  IQ is derived from standardised tests designed to asses an individuals intelligence.</p>

  <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
  <p>We connect with people everyday and being able to empathise and understand peoples 
    emotions means building better relationships. We're able to negotiate better, manage stress and look at things
    for other perspectives to get to the bottom of things.
