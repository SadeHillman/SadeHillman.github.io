      <h3>About</h3>
     <p>This blog section is about JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
  </div>
<p>I like to look at JavaScript,Html and CSS as a cute little family!<br>
  HTML acts as a responsible and organised parent by providing structure and order. CSS would be the creative child bringing style and beauty. JavaScript would be the clever child that adds interactivity, functionality and fun!
  HTML is the foundation were able to get out layout in order and ready to add all of our CSS and Javascript properties. CSS lets us add our own unique styles and flare to our web pages. JavaScript works with html and css to give us the moving bits and bobs that make webpages exciting like calculations at the press of a button or submitting forms from your web page to your email address.
  This happy little family is everything you need to build dynamic web site! </p>

<h3>Control Flow & Loops</h3>
<p>Control flow dictates the order instructions are executed. Loops are essential components of control flow that enable the repetition of a specific set of instructions. Here what that would look like as a gamer:
<ol>
  <li>Starting a game</li>
  <li>Moving forward, looking for quests</li>
  <li>If you come across quests, do them and collect the trophies</li>
  <li>Keep moving forward until the end</li>
  <li>Check if you have all the trophies </li>
  <li>If not repeat from step 2.</li>
</ol>
</p>
