Kia Ora, Im Sade Hillman :)

A bit about me,

Im 25 and live in Auckland with my husband and our 2 year old boy. I have a working background in trades, warehousing, retail and admin. I love learning new things so i changed feilds a little over the last 10 years. Ive been learning Front-end Development for the past couple months and im excited each day to see what i learn next!

So far ive built this blog space to hold all my Dev Academy Reflections and projects so i have some amazing things to take with me into the real world once i graduate. I have a good grasp on the fundamentals of HTML & CSS and im looking forward to adding Javascript to that list!
